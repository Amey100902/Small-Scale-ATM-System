# Small-Scale-ATM-System

I have developed a small-scale ATM machine using object-oriented programming concepts in the Java language. This program offers the user a range of options, including WITHDRAW, DEPOSIT, CHECK BALANCE, and EXIT. Depending on the user's selection, the program executes the corresponding functionality. This project demonstrates the utilization of core Java and OOP principles in an efficient and professional manner.
